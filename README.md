## Getting Started

## Generating Components

To generate a new component template, follow these steps:

1. Run the `yarn generate-component` command, followed by the name of the component you want to create. For example, to create a "Button" component:

```bash
yarn generate-component Button
```

2. You can find the newly generated component in the components directory, ready for you to start customizing and using in your Next.js application.
